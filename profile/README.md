## About Us

W.A.F.F.L.E.S. Community Robotics is a not-for-profit organization from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Since 2013, we've been competing as FRC Team 4476 - the first community-based FIRST Robotics Competition team in Canada.

We welcome students from grades 8-12 across the Kingston area who don't have access to a school-based robotics program.

## What is FRC?

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Teams have six weeks to design, build, and program a 125-pound robot to compete in that year's game. It combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology.

Students work alongside professional mentors to develop skills in:
- Mechanical design and fabrication
- Programming and controls
- Business and project management
- Teamwork and communication

## Our Performance

Team 4476 consistently ranks as a top-performing team in the Ontario District, regularly qualifying for playoffs and winning district events. We've qualified for the FIRST Championship multiple times since our rookie year.
